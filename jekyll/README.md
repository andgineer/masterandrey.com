# Jekyll local install

You do not need local jekyll installation if you just change file and put it on github.

But it always usefull to check it locally.

In that case you have to install jekyll and plugins for github (the plugins listed in `Gemfile` in this folder).

    brew install jekyll
    sudo -H gem install bundler
    bundler
