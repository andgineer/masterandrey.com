I am goint to show you how you can have rich test environment in no time
and without any efforts.

We will use Selenuim WebDriver.

And write tests in Python 3.

As test reporter we will use Allure.

And all of this can be spin up just in one command.

You need:
* Working docker-compose
* Python 3 (all pip package we will install)

Download [template](https://github.com/masterandrey/e2e-tests)

    git pull https://github.com/masterandrey/e2e-tests.git
    
Go to folder `e2e-tests` and run:    

    docker-compose up -d
    
Now we have reporting service on `http://localhost:4040`. 
It automatically builds reports for data inside folder `allure-results`.

Also now we have Selenium Grid up and running.
It serves `Chrome` and `Firefox` browsers so we can use them 
in tests. 

We use docker to run Selenium Grid because it is not so easy to
install head-less browsers for tests locally.
But with docker this is no-brainer.

That's all! Run tests with

    ./test.sh
    
And see report `http://localhost:4040`.
