What if you want to run fast and simple load and/or stress test for your application. 

And do not want to mess with jmeter and other heave machinery?

Here comes [Bombard](https://bombard.sorokin.engineer/en/latest/) - 
extremely simple tool for specifying HTTP-requests and scenarios and running them in parallel.

Installation

    pip install bombard

You write simple `bombard.yaml` like that

{% highlight yaml %}
ammo:
  postsList:
    url: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts"
{% endhighlight %}

Run it with

    bombard            

and after that you will see load test report in your terminal:

It bombards your application from parallel threads. 
By default 10, but you can change that with `--parallel` command line option (see full options
list with `--help`).

You can specify initialization steps in `prepare` section as shown in the example below.

And even use Python code - see `script` section in the example. 
The Python code calls `ammo.getPost` - requests described in
section `ammo`.

{% highlight yaml %}
supply:  # you can redefine it from command line (--supply host=http://localhost/)
  host: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/
prepare:  # Get ids from posts
  postsList:
    url: "{host}posts"  # use {host} from global supply
    script: |
      for post in resp[:3]:  # add getPost requests for 1st three posts in the list
        reload(ammo.getPost, id=post['id'])
ammo:
  getPost:
    url: "{host}posts/{id}"  # use {id} from the Python script above
    headers: json
{% endhighlight %}    

You do not need to remember all this sections and names.

To list all examples run

    bombard --examples
    
Each example you can run directly

    bombard --example easy
    
Or you can bootstrap local playbook `bombard.yaml` from any example

    bombard --init --example easy
    
After editing the playbook run it with

    bombard
