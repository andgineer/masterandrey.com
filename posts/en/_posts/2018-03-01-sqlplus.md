Oracle SQL*plus is awful and hard to install so I hope this post will help you to deal with it.
You will learn 

## Installation

Oracle server installation includes sqlplus.
Instruction below is for you if you do not need local Oracle server installation, just sqlplus
to control remote DB server.

Download http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/database-technologies/instant-client/downloads/index.html and install:

    sudo apt-get install alien
    sudo alien -i oracle-instantclient*-sqlplus*.rpm   
    sudo apt-get install libaio1
    sudo sensible-editor /etc/ld.so.conf.d/oracle.conf
    # указать в файле путь /usr/lib/oracle/12.2/client64/lib/
    sudo ldconfig 
    sudo ln -s /usr/bin/sqlplus64 /usr/bin/sqlplus
    
Add to .bashrc

    export ORACLE_HOME=/usr/lib/oracle/12.2/client64/lib
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$ORACLE_HOME"
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$ORACLE_HOME"
    export TNS_ADMIN=$ORACLE_HOME/admin/network

Save in the file `$ORACLE_HOME/admin/network/tnsnames.ora` your connection string:

    your_db_name =
      (DESCRIPTION =
        (ADDRESS_LIST =
          (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(Host = localhost)(Port = 1521))
          (SERVER=DEDICATED)
        )
        (CONNECT_DATA = (SERVICE_NAME = your_db))
      )

## Usage
    
To connect as DB super-user:

    sqlplus sys/sys_password@your_db_name as SYSDBA

To use command history (`up-arrow`) and auto-completion (`TAB`) you have to install `rlwrap`:

    sudo apt-get install rlwrap
    
Words for autocompletion place into file (separated by spaces or newlines):

    ~/.command_completions
    
Create alias `sql` so we do not have to type all this long command:

    alias -p sql='rlwrap -f ~/.command_completions sqlplus'

## Note about sys remote connection

To connect as DB super-user (SYSDBA) remotely we have to set "external" password for user sys. 
That's because by default user 'sys' have password only for internal login (from the same
host as DBMS).

External password (in the example below `sys_password`) will work for internal
and remote logins:

    alter user sys identified by sys_password;
    
## Compilation errors

If there are some errors in package or procedure, sqlplus just write "Warning: Package created with compilation errors.".

To see the errors use

    select * from dba_errors order by sequence;

## Nuning
`SET AUTOCOMMIT 1;` - autocommit each statement, useful if you want to play file
with inter-dependent inserts.

`/` after procedure or package body to compile it.

`EXIT` in the end of file (`@file_name`), so SQLplus will exit after executing it.
